      <h2>A short overview of Freeman Dyson's life:</h2>
      <p>Freeman Dyson was a great mathematician and physicist of the 20th centrury who worked closely with other great physicists like Richard Feynman and Hans Bethe.</p>
      <p>He was born in England in 1923 where he studied Mathematics at the University of Cambridge before serving in World War II as part of the R.A.F. (Royal Air Force) Bomber Command. Following the end of the war, he received his B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge in 1945.</p>
      <p>Between 1947 and 1951, Dyson spent some time in the United States as a visiting research fellow at the Cornell University and Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1951, he became professor of physics at Cornell University without having a Ph.D.</p>
      <p>2 years later, he took up the professor of physics position at the Institute of Advanced Study in Princeton, where he spent the rest of his career. Upon his retirement in 1994, he remained a staff member at Princeton as a Professor Emeritus, which he held until his death.

      <blockquote id="quote">"The great question for our time is, how to make sure that the continuing scientific revolution brings benefits to everybody rather than widening the gap between rich and poor. To lift up poor countries, and poor people in rich countries, from poverty, to give them a chance of a decent life, technology is not enough. Technology must be guided and driven by ethics if it is to do more than provide new toys for the rich." <br><small class="Author">--Freeman Dyson</small></blockquote>
